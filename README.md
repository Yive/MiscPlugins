# TownyUUIDFix

This plugin was created as a replacement for TownyNameUpdater back in 2018. This code has been untouched until recently to add H2 support. Which is untested as of right now.

This plugin was never made to look or act professional, it was just made to get the job done in a way that wasted less CPU cycles than TownyNameUpdater on large servers.
